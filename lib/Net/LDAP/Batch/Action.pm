=head1 NAME

Net::LDAP::Batch::Action - base class for LDAP actions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Net::LDAP::Batch::Action;
 my $action = Net::LDAP::Batch::Action->new(
            {
                ldap => $net_ldap_object,
            });
 $action->execute or $action->rollback;
        

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a base class for batch actions.

B<NOTE:> Net::LDAP::Batch::Action objects will croak() if anything
unusual happens. This approach assumes that Catastrophic Failure is a
Good Thing. So use eval() if you need to catch exceptions.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new( I<hash_ref> )

Overrides base Class::Accessor::Fast constructor to call init().

This class defines the following accessor methods, all of which
can be set via new() or by themselves.

=over

=item

ldap

=item

entry

=item

complete

=item

debug

=back

=cut

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my $self  = $class->SUPER::new(@_);
    $self->init;
    return $self;
}

=head2 init

Confirms that the ldap() accessor returns a Net::LDAP-derived object.

=cut

sub init {
    my $self = shift;
    if ( !$self->ldap or !$self->ldap->isa('Net::LDAP') ) {
        croak "Net::LDAP object required";
    }
    $self->debug( $ENV{LDAP_DEBUG} ) unless defined $self->debug;
    return $self;
}

=head2 execute

Perform the action. Default behaviour is to croak indicating
you must override the method in your subclass.

=cut

sub execute { croak "must override execute()" }

=head2 rollback

Undo the action. Default behaviour is to croak indicating you
must override the method in your subclass.

=cut

sub rollback { croak "must override rollback()" }

=head2 get_ldap_err( I<ldap_msg> )

Returns the stringified error message for the I<ldap_msg> object.

=cut

sub get_ldap_err {
    my $self = shift;
    my $msg  = shift or croak "ldap_msg required";
    my $str  = "\n"
        . join( "\n",
        "Return code: " . $msg->code,
        "Message: " . $msg->error_name,
        " :" . $msg->error_text,
        "MessageID: " . $msg->mesg_id,
        "DN: " . $msg->dn,
        ) . "\n";
    return $str;
}
